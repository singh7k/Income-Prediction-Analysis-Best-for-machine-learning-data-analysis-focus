# Income-Prediction-Analysis-Best-for-machine-learning-data-analysis-focus
This project analyzes the relationship between demographic features and income levels using a dataset of individuals' attributes. The goal is to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K based on factors like education, gender, age, and occupation.
Key Features of the Project:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, replaced placeholders ('?') with relevant categories, and encoded categorical variables using LabelEncoder.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored relationships between features like education, gender, race, and age concerning income. Visualized data using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Machine Learning Models: Split the dataset into training and testing sets and built predictive models to classify income levels.

Visualizations: Created insightful visualizations to analyze the following relationships:

Education vs Income

Gender vs Income

Gender vs Education

Race vs Income

Age vs Income
